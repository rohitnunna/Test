Initializer.GameConsole will initialize the board with Start and Dest along with the Snakes and Ladders and also the kind of dice that is intended for the game.
Once the  board initialization is done, the game would run for 10 runs as mandated. Sometimes the game might run in to the unintended states like in case of even dice and the pawn
ends up at odd locations and no snakes/ladders to make the location to even, these cases game will be suspended and the next game will be started.
